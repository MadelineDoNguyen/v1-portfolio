                <h3>Context</h3>
                <p>This project was initiated through UCSD's Global TIES Program, which focuses on social innovation and sustainable development. Global TIES connects interdisciplinary teams in collaboration with non-profit organizations to co-design impactful solutions. Our project aimed to address the growing need for mental health resources within the Vietnamese community. Given the cultural stigmas surrounding mental health, we created an easy-to-navigate, user-centered application.

                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>The final solution was a mobile app that provides a personalized and socio-culturally sustainable environment for Vietnamese youth, imitating the support they would get through a friend. With a minimalistic design, using pastel color themes and intuitive navigation, the application provides a sense of calm and focus. This enables users to pursue a balanced well-being check-in process. We incorporated design thinking tools and based the application’s features on personal needs, allowing us to design an application that empowers users to customize their experience. A typical use case scenario starts with a weekly focused topic chosen by the user. Upon logging into the application, the user is welcomed with curated resources based on their chosen topic. A simple and easy navigation system guides the user through daily activities such as mood check-ins, grounding exercises, and journal reflections.</p>

                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>We followed a user-centered design approach that included user research, wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing. We conducted interviews and surveys with community members and professionals to understand their needs and challenges. Based on our research, we iterated on our designs to ensure they met user expectations and needs.</p>
                
                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>To narrow down our research focus, we conducted a survey to gather insights into people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors regarding mental health. We received 12 responses from participants aged 20 to 30 years in the US. The survey results highlighted specific mental health issues, guiding the development of A Happier Me’s prototype. Utilizing design thinking tools, we created empathy maps, journey maps, and user personas to deeply understand our users' experiences, challenges, and frustrations. This comprehensive approach allowed us to empathize with our users and tailor A Happier Me to meet the unique needs of the community, fostering a supportive environment for mental health care and empowerment.</p>

                            <li>Would be interested in an app similar to HeadSpace if it were free and offered a space to find resources and recollect</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Dr. Saulman, a Clinical Psychologist at UCSD Counseling and Psychological Services </li>

                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>It was my first time conducting user research, and I gained valuable insights into the usability of the application. As I delved into the interviews, it became evident that some users faced challenges with accessibility and navigation. These insights were crucial in helping me understand the application from the users' perspective. Using Flutter for the app's UI design provided a versatile and efficient platform for development. However, the initial design choices didn't fully align with user expectations and needs. The user research highlighted specific areas for improvement, such as simplifying navigation and enhancing accessibility features.</p>
